# SIMD (AVX) Programming

SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) and MIMD are currently the most common parallelism in architectures. SIMD operations refers to a parallel computing method that enables processing of multiple data with a single instruction. In contrast, the conventional sequential approach using one instruction to process each individual data is called scalar operations. In Single Instruction Single Data (SISD), each instruction is applied on single data element while in SIMD a single instruction is applied on multiple elements of the data as given in Fig 1.
